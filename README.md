# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
ADPS Project 04 Audio Processing Web Based Tool

## Description
Topic 4-1: A web based tool to analyze the signals, such as FFT, DFT, STFT, Filtering such as LPF, HPF, BPF; Convolution, Audio effects (echo, change over pitch and time). Use Flask based python code and make as a back-end.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
It is a web interface using Flask
